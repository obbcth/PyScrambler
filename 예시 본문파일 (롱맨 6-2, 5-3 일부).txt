Not all people have a strong bout of typhoid fever; some people can have such a weak case that they only experience flu-like symptoms. Thus, [Mallon could have had typhoid fever but never known it].
Though commonly known at the time that typhoid could be spread by water or food products, people who are infected by the typhoid bacillus could also pass the disease via unwashed hands. For this reason, [infected persons who were cooks or food handlers had the most likelihood of spreading the disease].
On February 19, 1910. Mary Mallon agreed that she "is prepared to change her occupation (that of cook), and will give assurance by affidavit that [she will upon her release take such hygienic precautions as will protect those with whom she comes in contact], from infection." She was let free.
Though in the beginning Mallon tried to be a laundress as well as worked at other jobs, [for a reason that has not been left in any documents], Mallon eventually went back to working as a cook.
During her life, Mary Mallon experienced extreme punishment [for something in which she had no control and for whatever reason has gone down in history as the evasive and malicious] "Typhoid Mary."

Not only did this $23m support young artists just out of school, but artists in transition.
But the most important thing was: [the artist had a patron who made no aesthetic judgments].
But there are many people who will take a point of view as artists: I'll be this or that or the other. You've got to be what you are, [churning up the day in which you live and pull out of that experience something that is representative in artistic terms].
